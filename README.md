LaTeX Beamer Templates
======================

This repo hosts my own LaTeX beamer templates used in some of my slides.
This work is based on the beamer manual and some infos collected on the web.

The root of this repo contains directories where style files are stored.

For each theme there's an example file in the build directory.
